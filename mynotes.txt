- learn the shortcuts, they will quickly help you learn code.

generate content first
modify layout 2nd

elements will take up the entire width of the page by default

flexbox helps make it so the element will move to the side rather than the automatically underneath

add this to the main tag:
element.style {
display: flex;
}

utility class:
.d-flex {
    display: flex;
}
then go into the <main> tag and add the class <main class"d-flex">


can do this:
div {
    display: flex;
}

wouldn't be so good though becuase you wouldn't want that on all the divs

to swap the 2 sides is a little more complicated, but possible:

.d-flex {
    display: flex;
    flex-flow: row-reverse;

BOX MODEL
margin: outside the element (colorless, takes the color from the page)(pushes things away)
border: outside the element (has its own color)
padding: inbetween the border and the padding (shrinks content inside)
padding: inside the element 
Content: inside the element (actual physical text)

1 attribut
element.style {
    margin: 50 px    --does 50 px all the way around
    50px 30px       --does 50 px on top and bottom and 30 px on left and right
    50px 30px 10px 5px -- does 50 px top, right 30 px, 10 px bottom, 5 px right

if you don't want to affect the width of the element, use padding

vw is view width
element.style {
    padding: 2vw;
}

vh is view height
rem is root text type of page 2rem
em is relative tesxt type of the element 2em
height: 50%


horizontal allingment. and add space between them
element.style {
 justify-content: space-between;
 display: flex;
}

flex box is used within the element unless you use align-item: self

to bring things in on the left and right 
main {
 padding: 3em 1em
}
adide {
 padding-right .5em;
}
section {
 padding: 0px 3em;

ctrl d : finds matches of the same kind

line separaters

text-align: center;  centers the text

border-right: 1px solid grey; 	adds a border to the right
border-left: 1px dashed grey;   adds a dashed grey border

outlines all the elements on the page
* {
 outline: 1px solid red;
}

img and then tab
src="//placehold.it/200x350"
just takes up the space

src="http://placekitten.com/300/300"
